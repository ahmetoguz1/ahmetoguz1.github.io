          <p>This rule helps you take eye-catching pictures by using one of the most effective rules of
            composition.</p>
          <p>If you want to take pictures that have a “wow” factor built in them, the Rule of Thirds is the
            composition secret you need to take advantage of!</p>
          <p>To use the rule of thirds, imagine four lines, two lying horizontally across the
            image and two vertical creating nine even squares. Some images will look best with the focal
            point in the center square, but placing the subject off-center at one of the intersecting points
            of the imaginary lines will often create a more aesthetically composed photograph.</p>
          <p>When a photograph is composed using the rule of thirds the eyes will wander the
            frame. A picture composed using the rule of thirds is usually more pleasing to the eye.</p>

          <img src="images/photograpy-techniques/2-avoid-camera-shake.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="rightParagraph">
          <p>Camera shake or blur is something that can plague any photographer and here are some
            ways to avoid it.</p>
          <p>First, you need to learn how to hold your camera correctly; use both hands, one
            around the body and one around the lens and hold the camera close to your body for support.</p>
          <p>Also, for handheld shooting, make sure that you are using a shutter speed that is
            appropriate for your lens&#8217; focal length. If you&#8217;re shutter speed is too slow, any
            unintentional movement of the camera will result in your entire photograph coming out blurry.</p>
          <p>The rule of thumb is not to shoot at a shutter speed that is slower than your focal
            length to minimize this problem:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>1 / Focal Length (in mm) = Minimum Shutter Speed (in seconds)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>So, as an example, if you’re using a 100mm lens, then your shutter speed should be no
            lower than 1/100th of a second.</p>
          <p>Use a tripod or monopod whenever possible.</p>

          <img src="images/photograpy-techniques/3-exposure-triangle.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="rightParagraph">
          <p>To get your photos looking their best, you need to master the three basics: Aperture, Shutter Speed
            and ISO.</p>
          <p>You also need to understand the relationships between these three controls. When you adjust one of
            them, you would usually have to consider at least one of the others, to get the desired results.</p>
          <p>Using Auto Mode takes care of these controls, but you pay the price of not getting your photos to
            look the way you wanted them, and often disappointing.</p>

          <img src="images/photograpy-techniques/4-polarizing-filter.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="rightParagraph">
          <p>The recommended type of polarizer is circular because these allow your camera to use TTL (through the
            lens) metering such as auto exposure.</p>
          <p>This filter helps reduce reflections from water as well as metal and glass; it
            improves the colors of the sky and foliage and will help give your photos the WOW factor. It will do
            all that while protecting your lens. There’s no reason why you can’t leave it on for all of your
            photography.</p>

        <div class="rightParagraph">
          <p>When photographing landscapes, it helps to create a sense of depth, in other words, make the viewer
            feel like they are there.</p>
          <p>Use a wide-angle lens for a panoramic view and a small aperture of f/16 or smaller to keep the
            foreground and background sharp. Placing an object or person in the foreground helps give a sense of
            scale and emphasizes how far away the distance is.</p>
          <p>Use a tripod if possible, as a small aperture usually requires a slower shutter speed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="rightParagraph">
          <p>The simple approach is usually the best in digital photography, and you have to decide what needs to
            be in the shot, while not including anything that is a distraction.</p>
          <p>If possible, choose a plain background – in other words, neutral colors and simple patterns. You want
            the eye to be drawn to the focal point of the image rather than a patch of color or an odd building
            in the background. This is especially vital in a shot where the model is placed off center.</p>

        <p>Each of those subjects or photography genres come with their own unique challenges.</p>
        <p>Knowing the kinds of subjects that will be in front of your camera will help you narrow down your camera
          search. Generally, cameras fall into five categories now:</p>
        <ol class="biglist">
          <li><strong>DSLRs</strong> (with interchangeable lenses)</li>
          <li><strong>Mirrorless or four-thirds cameras</strong> (with interchangeable lenses)</li>
          <li><strong>Compact cameras </strong>(this includes both Point &amp; Shoot AND bridge cameras, neither
            of
            which&nbsp;have interchangeable lenses)</li>
          <li><strong>Smartphones</strong> (you may already have one of these)</li>
          <li><strong>Specialty cameras</strong> like GoPro, drones, or dedicated video cameras (I&rsquo;m not
            going
            to cover those in this article, however).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
          of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
          desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
          evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
